## Statement

The **suffix array** of `s` lists the starting positions of all its suffixes, in the **dictionary order of the suffixes**. For `"banana"` the suffixes sorted are `a, ana, anana, banana, na, nana` (starting at 5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2), so the answer is `[5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2]`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
suffix_array('banana')
```

Output:

```text
[5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2]
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
suffix_array('aaaa')
```

Output:

```text
[3, 2, 1, 0]
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(s) <= 10000`
- Lower-case letters.

## Theory

Sorting the suffixes as strings, `sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: s[i:])`, builds `n` strings of total length `n²/2`, which is too much memory and time for long strings.

**Prefix doubling:** give every suffix a rank based on its first `k` letters (start with `k = 1`: the rank of the letter). Then sort the suffixes by the pair `(rank[i], rank[i + k])`, which orders them by their first `2k` letters, and renumber the ranks. Repeat with `k = 2, 4, 8, ...` until all ranks are different or `k >= n`. That is `O(log n)` rounds, each a sort of `n` pairs: `O(n log² n)`.

The suffix array together with the **LCP array** (longest common prefix of neighbours) solves many string questions: number of distinct substrings, longest repeated substring, pattern search by binary search.

## Explanation

Prefix doubling. Treat each suffix as a cyclic shift of `s + sentinel` (the sentinel is smaller than every letter), and give every shift a class number by its first `2^k` letters. To sort by the first `2^(k+1)` letters, sort by the second half and then, stably, by the first half; both halves are class numbers, so counting sort does it in O(n). Equal pairs get the same new class. After `log2(n)` rounds all shifts are in their final order; dropping the sentinel's own shift gives the suffix array.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n log n). Prefix doubling: after each of the `log n` rounds the suffixes are ordered by their first `2^k` letters, and each round is two counting sorts of O(n). (A linear-time algorithm, SA-IS, exists but is much longer).
- Space: O(n). The order, class and counting arrays.
