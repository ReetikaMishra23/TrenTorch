## Statement

Count the ways to choose exactly `k` positions from `nums` so that the chosen values add up to `target`. Two choices are different if they use different positions, even when the values are equal.

Choosing zero items (`k = 0`) gives exactly one way, with sum `0`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
count_subset_sums([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 5)
```

Output:

```text
2
```

The positions with values (1, 4) and (2, 3).

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
count_subset_sums([2, 2, 2], 2, 4)
```

Output:

```text
3
```

Every pair of positions works: 3 ways.

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(nums) <= 22`
- `0 <= k <= len(nums)`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `-2200 <= target <= 2200`

## Theory

When `n` is small, trying all the choices is the right answer, and the work is how you enumerate them. `itertools.combinations(items, k)` yields every way to pick `k` items without repeats, in order, without writing nested loops. There are `C(n, k)` of them: for `n = 22` and `k = 11` that is 705,432, fine for a computer, impossible by hand.

Related tools in `itertools`: `permutations` (order matters), `product` (cartesian product, with repeats), `combinations_with_replacement`. Knowing which one matches a problem saves a lot of recursion code.

## Explanation

Meet in the middle. Split `nums` into two halves. For each half, count how many of its subsets have each pair `(size, sum)`; one half has at most `2^(n/2)` subsets. A chosen subset of the whole list is one subset from each half, so for every `(size, sum)` of the right half you look up how many left subsets have `(k - size, target - sum)` and multiply the two counts.

Equal values at different positions stay different choices because subsets are built from positions. With `k = 0` the empty subset has sum `0`.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(2^(n/2)). Meet in the middle: each half has at most `2^(n/2)` subsets and every right-half subset needs one dictionary lookup.
- Space: O(2^(n/2)). The dictionary of `(size, sum)` counts for the left half.
