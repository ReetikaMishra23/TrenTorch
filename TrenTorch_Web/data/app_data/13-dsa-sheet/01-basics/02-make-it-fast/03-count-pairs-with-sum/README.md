## Statement

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return how many pairs of positions `i < j` have `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`.

Pairs are counted by position, so equal values at different positions count separately.

The starter code checks every pair. Make it fast.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
count_pairs_with_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 3], 6)
```

Output:

```text
2
```

Positions (1, 3) give 2 + 4 and positions (2, 4) give 3 + 3.

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
count_pairs_with_sum([2, 2, 2], 4)
```

Output:

```text
3
```

All three pairs of positions sum to 4.

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(nums) <= 2 * 10**5`
- `-10**9 <= nums[i], target <= 10**9`
- The answer can exceed `10**10`.

## Explanation

Go left to right. When you reach `x`, every earlier element equal to `target - x` forms a valid pair with it, and there are `seen[target - x]` of them. Add that, then do `seen[x] += 1`.

`Counter` returns `0` for missing keys, so no extra check is needed. Updating after the lookup avoids pairing an element with itself.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n). One pass with one hash lookup and one update per element (O(1) on average).
- Space: O(n). The counter may hold every distinct value.
