## Statement

Children stand in a line with ratings `ratings[i]`. Every child gets **at least one** candy, and a child with a **higher rating than a neighbour** must get **more candies than that neighbour**. Return the **fewest candies** needed.

For `[1, 0, 2]` the answer is `5` (candies `2, 1, 2`).

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
candy([1, 0, 2])
```

Output:

```text
5
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
candy([1, 2, 2])
```

Output:

```text
4
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(ratings) <= 200000`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 10**9`

## Explanation

Walk once and treat the ratings as a series of rising runs and falling runs. Give 1 candy to the first child. For each next child:

- Rating higher than the previous: `up` grows by one and the child gets `1 + up` candies (one more than before in the rising run).
- Equal rating: the run resets and the child gets 1.
- Lower rating: `down` grows by one and the child gets `1 + down` (the falling run counts candies backwards from its end). If the falling run has become as long as the rising run before it (`peak`), the child at the top of the hill needs one more candy than we gave, which the formula already counted once, so subtract one.

Only the lengths of the current runs are kept, so no array of candies is needed.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

| After this line         | Variables                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `n = len(ratings)`      | `n = 3`                                 |
| `up = down = peak = 0`  | `total = 1, up = 0, down = 0, peak = 0` |
| `for i in range(1, n):` | `i = 1`                                 |
| `total += 1 + down`     | `total = 3, down = 1`                   |
| `for i in range(1, n):` | `i = 2`                                 |
| `down = 0`              | `up = 1, down = 0`                      |
| `peak = up`             | `peak = 1`                              |
| `return`                | `returned = 5`                          |

### Complexity

- Time: O(n). One pass; the candies in a rising run and in a falling run are summed as arithmetic series, so no per-child array is needed.
- Space: O(1). A few counters.
