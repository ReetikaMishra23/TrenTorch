## Statement

Every row of `matrix` contains only `0` and `1`, and each row is **sorted**: all its `0`s come before all its `1`s. Return the **index of the row with the most `1`s**. If several rows tie, return the smallest index. If there is no `1` anywhere, return `-1`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
row_with_most_ones([[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]])
```

Output:

```text
1
```

Row 1 has three `1`s.

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
row_with_most_ones([[0, 0], [0, 0]])
```

Output:

```text
-1
```

There is no `1`.

### Constraints

- `0 <= rows, cols`, and `rows * cols <= 2 * 10**5`
- Every row is sorted: zeros first, then ones.
- The big tests count how many cells you read.

## Theory

Counting the ones in every row means reading every cell: `O(rows * cols)`. Because each row is sorted, the number of ones in a row is `cols - (index of its first 1)`, and the index of the first `1` is a **lower bound** search: binary search for the first position where the value is `1`.

So the whole matrix costs `rows * log(cols)` reads instead of `rows * cols`. Keep the row with the most ones; comparing with a strict `>` keeps the smallest index when rows tie.

(There is an even faster `O(rows + cols)` staircase walk from the top-right corner, but the per-row binary search is the straightforward application of this topic.)

## Explanation

Keep `col`, the start of the ones in the best row so far (`col = cols` means no ones yet). For every row, move `col` left while the cell just before it is a one; if it moved, this row has more ones than any earlier one, so remember it. A row that cannot move `col` costs one check.

`col` never moves right, so the total walk is at most `cols` steps plus one check per row: `O(r + c)`. Ties keep the earlier row because only a strictly longer run changes the answer.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

| `for i, row in enumerate(matrix):` | `best_row = 1, i = 2, row = [0, 0, 0, 1]`                |
| `return`                           | `returned = 1`                                           |

### Complexity

- Time: O(r + c). One pointer walks left along the best row boundary and never moves back; each row costs one check plus the cells the pointer passes.
- Space: O(1). Two numbers.
