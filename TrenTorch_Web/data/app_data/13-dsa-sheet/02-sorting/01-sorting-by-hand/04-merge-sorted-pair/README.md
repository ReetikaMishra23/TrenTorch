## Statement

You get two lists `a` and `b`, each sorted in increasing order. Merge them with the standard two-pointer method:

1. Keep a position in each list, both starting at `0`.
2. While both lists still have values left, **compare** the two current values. Take the smaller one into the result and move that list's position forward. If they are equal, take the one from `a`.
3. When one list runs out, add everything left in the other list **without comparing**.

Return a list of two things: `[merged, comparisons]`, where `merged` is the combined sorted list and `comparisons` is how many comparisons step 2 made.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
merge_sorted_pair([1, 4, 7], [2, 3, 9])
```

Output:

```text
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9], 5]
```

Comparisons: 1v2, 4v2, 4v3, 4v9, 7v9. Then `9` is left over and added without a comparison.

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
merge_sorted_pair([], [5, 6])
```

Output:

```text
[[5, 6], 0]
```

`a` is empty, so no comparisons are made.

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(a), len(b) <= 2 * 10**5`
- Both lists are sorted in increasing order.
- `-10**9 <= value <= 10**9`

## Explanation

Two indexes `i` and `j` walk the lists. While both are in range, count one comparison and append the smaller value (using `<=` so ties come from `a`). After the loop, `a[i:]` and `b[j:]` are sorted and at most one of them is non-empty, so extend the result with both.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n + m). Each step appends one value and moves one pointer forward, with `n` and `m` the list lengths.
- Space: O(n + m). The merged list is the result.
