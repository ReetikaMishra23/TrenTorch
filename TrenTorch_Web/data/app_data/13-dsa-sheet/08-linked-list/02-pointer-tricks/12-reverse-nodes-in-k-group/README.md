## Statement

Reverse the nodes of the list **`k` at a time** and return the head. If the number of nodes left at the end is less than `k`, leave that last group as it is. Change the pointers, not the values.

For `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `k = 2` the answer is `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`.

The tests show a list as a Python list of its values: `[1, 2, 3]` stands for `1 -> 2 -> 3`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
reverse_k_group(head, 2)  # head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

Output:

```text
[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
reverse_k_group(head, 3)  # head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

Output:

```text
[3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= number of nodes <= 100000`
- `1 <= k <= 100000`

## Explanation

Reversing with `prev = group_next` means the old first node of the block points at the node after the block. `first` (the old first node) is now the block's tail, and it is the `group_prev` for the next block.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n). Every node is visited a constant number of times: once to find the group end and once to reverse it.
- Space: O(1). A few pointers.
