## Statement

`head` is sorted in increasing order. Delete **every node whose value appears more than once**, so only values that were already distinct remain. For `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5` the answer is `1 -> 2 -> 5`.

The tests show a list as a Python list of its values: `[1, 2, 3]` stands for `1 -> 2 -> 3`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
remove_all_duplicates(head)  # head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5
```

Output:

```text
[1, 2, 5]
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
remove_all_duplicates(head)  # head = 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

Output:

```text
[2, 3]
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= number of nodes <= 100000`
- The list is sorted in increasing order.

## Explanation

A repeat triggers an inner loop that skips the whole group. The outer pointers move on only when the node is unique.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n). One pass; every run of equal values is skipped as a whole.
- Space: O(1). Two pointers.
