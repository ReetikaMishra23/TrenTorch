## Statement

Two lists can **merge into one chain**: from some node on, both lists are the very same nodes (not just equal values). Return the **first shared node**, or `None` if the lists never meet. Do not change the lists and use `O(1)` extra memory.

The tests build `list_b` from its own nodes followed by a join: `{"values": [...], "join": {"param": "list_a", "index": k}}` means its last node points at node `k` of `list_a` (`k = -1` means no join). The tests check the position of the node you returned in `list_a`.

The starter code compares every pair of nodes. It is correct but too slow.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
intersection_node(list_a, list_b)  # list_a = 4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5, list_b = 5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5
```

Output:

```text
2
```

The lists meet at the node with value 8 (position 2 of `list_a`).

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
intersection_node(list_a, list_b)  # list_a = 2 -> 6 -> 4, list_b = 1 -> 5, no shared node
```

Output:

```text
-1
```

No shared node: the answer is `None`, shown as `-1`.

### Constraints

- `0 <= number of nodes <= 100000` in each list
- Neither list has a cycle.

## Explanation

Each pointer travels its own list and then the other one. The shorter list's pointer switches earlier, which removes the length difference. The loop ends when the pointers are the same node or both `None`.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n + m). Each pointer walks its list and then the other, so both cover `n + m` nodes and meet at the intersection (or at the end).
- Space: O(1). Two pointers.
