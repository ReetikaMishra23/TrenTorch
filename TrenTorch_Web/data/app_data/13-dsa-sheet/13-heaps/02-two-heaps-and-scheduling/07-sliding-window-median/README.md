## Statement

A window of size `k` slides over `nums` one position at a time. Return the **median of each window**: the middle value for an odd `k`, or the average of the two middle values for an even `k`, as decimals.

For `nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]` and `k = 3` the answer is `[1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0]`.

The starter code sorts every window from scratch. It is correct but too slow when windows are large.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
median_sliding_window([1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], 3)
```

Output:

```text
[1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0]
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
median_sliding_window([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2], 3)
```

Output:

```text
[2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 100000`
- `-10**9 <= nums[i] <= 10**9`

## Explanation

Keep two heaps: `small` (a max-heap) with the lower half of the window and `large` (a min-heap) with the upper half, so the median is at the top of one or both. Adding a value goes to the half it belongs to and the heaps are rebalanced to differ in size by at most one.

A heap cannot remove an arbitrary value cheaply, so a value that leaves the window is only counted in a `delayed` table, and the live sizes are adjusted at once. When a delayed value reaches the top of its heap it is popped for real.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n log n). Two heaps hold the lower and upper half of the window, and values that left the window are removed lazily when they reach the top.
- Space: O(n). The two heaps and the table of pending removals.
