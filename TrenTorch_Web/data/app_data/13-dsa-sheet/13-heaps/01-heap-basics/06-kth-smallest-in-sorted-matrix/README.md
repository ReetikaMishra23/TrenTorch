## Statement

`matrix` has every **row sorted** and every **column sorted** in increasing order. Return the **`k`-th smallest** value (counting from 1, repeated values counted separately).

For `[[1, 5, 9], [10, 11, 13], [12, 13, 15]]` and `k = 8` the answer is `13`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
kth_smallest_matrix([[1, 5, 9], [10, 11, 13], [12, 13, 15]], 8)
```

Output:

```text
13
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
kth_smallest_matrix([[-5]], 1)
```

Output:

```text
-5
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= rows, cols <= 300`
- `1 <= k <= rows * cols`
- `-10**9 <= value <= 10**9`

## Explanation

Binary search on the value, not on an index. For a guess `x`, count how many cells are `<= x`: start at the last column of the first row; for each row, move left while the cell is larger than `x`; what is left of the pointer counts. Because rows and columns are sorted, the pointer only moves left, so a count costs `r + c` steps.

The smallest `x` whose count reaches `k` is the answer, and it is always a value that appears in the matrix. This costs the same for every `k`, whereas popping `k` values from a heap costs `k log r`.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O((r + c) log(max - min)). Binary search on the value; counting the values `<= x` takes one staircase walk of `r + c` steps.
- Space: O(1). A few numbers.
