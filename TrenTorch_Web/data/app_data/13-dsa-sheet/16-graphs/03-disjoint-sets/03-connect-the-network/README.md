## Statement

`n` computers (`0` to `n - 1`) are joined by cables `connections` (`[a, b]`). In one operation you can take a cable between two directly connected computers and use it to join any two computers instead. Return the **fewest operations** to make all computers connected, or `-1` if it is impossible.

For `n = 4` and `connections = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]]` the answer is `1`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
make_connected(4, [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]])
```

Output:

```text
1
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
make_connected(6, [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]])
```

Output:

```text
2
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 100000`
- `0 <= len(connections) <= 200000`

## Explanation

`components` starts at `n` and drops by one for every successful union. The cable count test decides when the answer is impossible.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n * alpha(n)). One union-find operation per cable; with union by size and path halving each operation is `O(alpha(n))`, which is below 5 for any input that fits in memory.
- Space: O(n). The parent and size arrays.
