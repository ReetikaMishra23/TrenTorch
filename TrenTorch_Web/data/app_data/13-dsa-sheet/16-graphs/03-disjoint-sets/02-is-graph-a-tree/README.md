## Statement

A graph has `n` nodes (`0` to `n - 1`) and undirected `edges`. Return `True` if it is a **tree**: connected and without cycles.

For `n = 5` and `edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]` the answer is `True`; adding `[2, 3]` makes it `False`.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
valid_tree(5, [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]])
```

Output:

```text
True
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
valid_tree(5, [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]])
```

Output:

```text
False
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 100000`
- `0 <= len(edges) <= 200000`
- An empty graph (`n = 0`) is not a tree.

## Explanation

With exactly `n - 1` edges, "no cycle" and "connected" are the same condition, so detecting a cycle with union-find is enough.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n * alpha(n)). One union-find operation per edge; with union by size and path halving each operation is `O(alpha(n))`, which is below 5 for any input that fits in memory.
- Space: O(n). The parent and size arrays.
