## Statement

A **substring** is a block of **consecutive** characters. Return the length of the **longest substring that appears in both `a` and `b`**.

For `a = "abcdxyz"` and `b = "xyzabcd"` the answer is `4` (`"abcd"`).

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
longest_common_substring('abcdxyz', 'xyzabcd')
```

Output:

```text
4
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
longest_common_substring('zxabcdezy', 'yzabcdezx')
```

Output:

```text
6
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(a), len(b) <= 900`
- Lower-case letters.

## Theory

**Dynamic programming (DP)** solves a problem by combining the answers to smaller versions of the same problem and **remembering** them, so each smaller version is solved only once. It works when the plain recursion keeps asking the same questions (**overlapping subproblems**) and the best answer is built from best answers of smaller parts (**optimal substructure**). The recipe: pick the **state** (what identifies one subproblem), write the **transition** (how a state's answer comes from smaller states), set the **base cases**, and choose the **order**: top-down recursion with a cache, or a bottom-up table. A table often needs only its last row or last few values, which saves memory.

Unlike the subsequence question, characters must be **consecutive**, so a mismatch resets the run. **State:** `run(i, j)`, the length of the longest common suffix of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. **Transition:** if `a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]` then `run(i, j) = 1 + run(i - 1, j - 1)`, otherwise `0`. The answer is the **maximum** over all cells (not the corner). `O(len(a) × len(b))`, one row at a time.

## Explanation

A suffix automaton of `a` is a small graph that contains every substring of `a` as a path from the start state. It can be built in linear time and has at most `2 * len(a)` states, each with a `length` (the longest substring that ends there) and a `link` to the state of the longest proper suffix that is in a different class.

Walk through `b` letter by letter with the current state and the current match length. If the letter extends the match, follow that edge and add one. If not, follow `link`s until some state has the letter (the match length drops to that state's `length`), or restart from the start state with length 0. The longest length seen is the answer. Each step either moves forward or shortens the match, so the walk is linear.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n + m). A suffix automaton of the first string is built in linear time, and the second string walks through it once, keeping the length of the current match.
- Space: O(n). The automaton has at most `2n` states.
