## Statement

`s` contains only `(` and `)`. Return the length of the **longest substring** (consecutive characters) that is a **valid** parentheses string (every `(` closed in the right order).

For `")()())"` the answer is `4`.

The starter code checks every substring. It is correct but too slow for long strings.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```python
longest_valid_parentheses(')()())')
```

Output:

```text
4
```

**Example 2**

Input:

```python
longest_valid_parentheses('(()')
```

Output:

```text
2
```

### Constraints

- `0 <= len(s) <= 200000`

## Explanation

Scan left to right counting `(` as `left` and `)` as `right`. When the counts are equal, the stretch so far is balanced: its length is `2 * left`. When `right` exceeds `left`, no valid stretch can include this bracket, so reset both. That finds every valid stretch except those with extra `(` that never get closed, like `(()`. A second scan from right to left with the roles of the brackets swapped finds those. No stack is needed.

### Worked example

The solution run on example 1, one step at a time. The values are recorded from the real code.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n). Two scans, one from each end, counting opening and closing brackets.
- Space: O(1). Two counters.
